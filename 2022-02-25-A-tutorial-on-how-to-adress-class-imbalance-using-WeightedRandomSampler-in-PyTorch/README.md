Class imbalance is a very common problem in real world datasets. For example, a medical diagnosis dataset may have large number samples corresponding to the healthy class and very few samples belonging to the disease class. Class imbalance is detrimental to performance of the model, and it can lead to a very poor generalization. There are many ways to address this issue. In this article, we will focus on sampling strategies which can be implemented very easily in PyTorch.
